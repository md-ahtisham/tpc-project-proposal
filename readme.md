**two-way intelligent WhatsApp chatbot**

that responds to students with personalized, up-to-date info using LLMs. That’s solid. Let me walk you through a high-level overview of how the backend can be designed.

So think of it like this:

At the heart, there are three moving parts—the LLM system, the WhatsApp API, and your event data source (like an Excel sheet, Google Sheet, or database). Here's how the system would run:

User Sends Message on WhatsApp:
A registered student sends a message like “What are the upcoming events for CSE?” or “Is there any talk tomorrow?”

WhatsApp API Receives It:
That message is received on your server through a webhook from the WhatsApp Business API.

Server and LLM Handle the Logic:
Your backend (in Python with Flask or FastAPI) processes the message, cleans it up, maybe adds context (like which department or batch the user is from), and forms a prompt.
This prompt is sent to the LLM (like OpenAI GPT, Gemini, or Claude).

LLM Processes the Prompt + External Data:
Now, here’s the clever part: the LLM doesn’t just respond blindly—it can use external tools like pandas or LlamaIndex to access and reason over the Excel or Sheet data you have (which contains events, dates, departments, etc.).
So you can do something like:
“You’re a chatbot helping IIT Patna students. Use the following sheet data to answer their queries accurately.”

LLM Returns Response → Sent to WhatsApp:
The response is captured, and the backend sends it back to the student via the WhatsApp API.

Optional – Logging & Personalization:
You can store chat logs, preferences (like which departments the student follows), and tailor future replies even more.

For Event Broadcasting:
Apart from interactive replies, you can also push messages proactively to all or filtered users (say only 2nd-year CSE students) by scheduling scripts that send out updates.
